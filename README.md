# Face Cropper for ID Photos

A simple Python-based tool to detect and crop frontal faces from images, optimized for ID card photos. It processes all images in the `img/` folder, detects faces that are fully visible and front-facing, crops them with padding, and resizes them to **720Ã—720 pixels**, saving the results in the `crop_img/` folder.

## ðŸ“‹ Features
- Uses OpenCVâ€™s deep learning face detector for accurate frontal face detection.
- Filters out partial or side-profile faces by checking aspect ratio and bounding box boundaries.
- Automatically crops and resizes detected faces to 720Ã—720 pixels suitable for ID cards.
- Processes multiple images in batch mode.
- Simple, easy-to-use Python script.

## âœ… Step 2: Prepare Your Project Directory



mkdir img crop_img

Add the images you want to process in the img/ folder.


## âœ… Step 3: Run the Python Script
With everything set up, you can run the script using:

bash

python face_cropper.py


The script will:
âœ” Detect faces in each image
âœ” Verify that the face is fully visible and front-facing
âœ” Crop the face with padding
âœ” Resize it to 720Ã—720 pixels
âœ” Save the result in the crop_img/ folder
